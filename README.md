# Visualize Data with a Bar Chart 

[Demo](https://adamcodes2843.github.io/Visualize-Data-With-A-Bar-Chart/)

## freeCodeCamp Data Visualization Project

This is the first project for the fCC Data Visualization Certificate and the first time I've built a page using d3. I used a walkthrough found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5vxVj8g3cs). Ganesh helped me understand how to utilitize and get comfortable with the concepts covered in the fCC tutorials.

### Practiced/Learned

- setting up d3 
- fetching, parsing and storing data from json/api 
- variables and functions necessary to make bars and an x and y axis
- svg
- domain and range
- tooltip
- select, append, attr, style, on, and other methods
